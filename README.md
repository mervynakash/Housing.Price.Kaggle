# Housing Price Competition - Kaggle
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.  With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.


# File descriptions
- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
- sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

# HouseClean.R
The Dataset has 76 columns and Missing Values in some of the columns. With the help of "MICE" package the missing values were predicted with the help of Random Forest since there were both categorical and numerical missing values. 
Since there are many predictors I used PCA to subset the predictors which are showing more variance in the target variable.
Then I saved the datasets in this file in the .RData format.

# HouseEDA.R
For imputing the missing values in the columns I took the help of PDM Package (https://github.com/mervynakash/PDM) which I developed. Boruta Package was used for feature selection. 
Then the datasets in this file were saved in a .RData format for future use.

# Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- MARSpline Forward Pruning
- MARSpline Backward Pruning
- MARSpline Cross Validation
- Lasso Reguralization

# Error Rate in each model
- Decision Tree = 0.19816
- Random Forest = 0.25028
- KNN = 0.20844
- MARSpline Forward Pruning = 0.24304
- MARSpline Backward Pruning = 0.24304
- MARSpline Cross Validation = 0.21918

After PDM + Boruta:
- MARSpline Forward Pruning - 0.15351

# Current Rank = 2840
Edit: 
New Rank = 2649 (after PDM + Boruta intriduction)
